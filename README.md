# Xam-Cognitive-Demo

This repo includes a Xamarin.Forms Demo (Droid and UWP) that integrates Face, Emotion and Vision Cognitive Services in order to perform a near realtime evaluation by processing the camera frame.
Custom Renderers use is mandatory since Xamarin.Forms does not provide a Camera Control.
